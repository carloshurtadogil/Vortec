# Vortec

Vortec is a unique experience based off the classic Asteroids game from the late 70â€™s. Featuring a high-end graphic design and a seamless user-interface, the game provides a nostalgic experience for generations old and new.
When the user opens the app, they are first taken to a main menu where they have the options to begin a new game, continue a previous one, adjust certain audio aspects of the game, or simply exit the application. During gameplay, users can pause the game, save at certain checkpoints, or quit at any time. The game offers a unique, more advanced structure than previous versions of Asteroids, which will be enjoyed for generations to come.
